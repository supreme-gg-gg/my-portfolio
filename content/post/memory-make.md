As memories pile up in our camera rolls or remain abstract ideas, we wanted to create a way to truly experience them. MemoryMake was born from the idea of transforming ordinary photos and text prompts into dynamic, navigable, and visually engaging 3D environmentsâ€”so users can explore their cherished moments instead of merely scrolling past them.

Paul, Nelson, and I built Memory Make by taking the unconventional route, stepping away from common hackathon LLM apps and focusing on cutting edge computer vision research. We won the best social hacks at Queen's University's QHacks 2025.
