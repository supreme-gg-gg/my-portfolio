## std::cout << "Hello, World!";

I am a first year undergraduate student studying Engineering Science at the University of Toronto. I am passionate about machine learning and its application in interdisciplinary fields such as fintech and biomedical engineering. 

Outside of hackathons, design teams, and personal projects, I enjoy reading classic literature and philosophy.
