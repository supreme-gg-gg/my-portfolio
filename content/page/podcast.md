Sharing ideas and stories from the world of science, technology, and philosophy always excites me. Podcasting and talks is one of the best ways to share these ideas with the world. In this page you can find a collecting of my past and present podcast and talks.

## Of Sand and Stars

{{< figure src="/img/of-sand-and-stars.png" width="50%" >}}

In the winter of 2024, my friend Calo and I started a podcast called "Of Sand and Stars", where we explored life in the technological era. We looked at how technology has shaped our past, is redefining our present, and will influence our future. Reflecting on the relationship between technology and humanity, we devoted ourselves to 5 hour-long deep talk revolving around our passion in philosophy, literature, and storytelling through books, films, and TV shows. Together, we discussed topics like the growing-up experience in the digital age, the transformation of creativity and education, ethics in AI, the meaning of work, and the interplay of intelligence and consciousness.
