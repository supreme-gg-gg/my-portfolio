## Interests

I am passionate about machine learning and its applications in biomedical engineering, particularly in cognitive science and neurotechnology, drawing inspiration from the human brain to create intelligent machines.

Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at St. George Capital and NeuroTech, and contribute to two student design teams at UofT focused on quantitative finance and neurotechnology. I have also interned as a Software Engineer at Ericsson. Driven by a passion for machine learning, software engineering, and entrepreneurship, I seek continuous growth through side projects, hackathons, and collaborative problem-solving.

Outside of academics and work, I enjoy reading great works of classic literature and philosophy.

## Skills

I am proficient in machine learning, data science, full stack development, iOS development, and software engineering. Here are the technologies I am familiar with:
